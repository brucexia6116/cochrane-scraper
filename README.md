# Cochrane Parser

These two Java programs get all references and statistical data from studies in the Cochrane Library. (http://www.cochranelibrary.com/)

For each referenced PubMed article, we retrieve the author's firstname and gender. The data, references, and genders will be processed and used in a scientific article.
